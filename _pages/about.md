My name is Christian Philip Zabala and I’m a curious person which results in me having too many interests and get overwhelmed on the various technologies I want to learn but that's not a problem for me because learning something new makes me excited. Currently, I work for Astreya as a Network Deployment Engineer. My previous jobs are NOC Engineer and Technical Service Engineer(Wireless).


I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering from Lyceum-Northwestern University.
I also have industry certifications which are Cisco ENCOR, CCNA Routing and Switching, JNCIA-DevOps, JNCIA-Junos, JNCDA, and JNCIA-Cloud which I have learned a lot while studying for those certifications. The main purpose of why I created this blog is to share the resources and the topics for the knowledge that I have learned from studying those certifications and perhaps have a Tagalog explanation to help my fellow Filipinos. 

I mostly used my free time on learning Routing & Switching especially the technologies that the company I’m working on has like BGP, IS-IS, OSPF, VPLS, MPLS-TE, Multicast Routing (PIM, IGMP), and other technologies or protocols for an ISP. When I don’t feel like studying R&S I switch on learning Linux and Network Automation(Python, APIs, Docker, etc.) and many other things like web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front-end frameworks like Angular or React) because in the future I want to design or perhaps just help the web developers to integrate the backend automation for the network to a beautiful Dashboard UI and also to improve this website. Currently, I’m writing codes in Python but I plan to study also Golang after I’m comfortable already using Python. For now, I have only small personal projects that I’m currently working on which I will share on the Programming page of this blog.

Aside from Technology, I also enjoy watching movies, documentaries videos, and going out with my family or friends to eat and have some beers.

**NOTE:** 
- All of the content of this blog are expressed on my own opinions or my point of view and does not represent the views of others or any organization. Perhaps it may not even represent my own opinion by the time you have read the topics.  

- I’m not a perfect person and only have few experiences in the IT industry, so the content of this blog might have incorrect information, misspelled words, incorrect grammar, and other issues since I’m not fluent in speaking and writing in English. But I will always do my best to only share the things that I am sure about and have double-checked it. I will also update the contents on the posts that I shared once I realized that there is something wrong or missing, or have experienced something that might improve a post.
