My name is Christian Philip Zabala and I’m a curious person which results for me to having too many interests and get overwhelmed on the various technologies I want to learn but that's not a problem for me because learning something new makes me excited. Currently I work for Concentrix as a NOC Engineer, Our team is mainly responsible for monitoring the stability and performance of the Network and IP TV System of the World's Biggest Search Engine ISP Account of Concentrix .


I hold a Bachelors of Science in Electronics Engineering from Lyceum-Northwestern University.
I also have industry certifications which are CCNA Routing and Switching, JNCIA-DevOps, JNCIA-Junos, JNCDA, and JNCIA-Cloud which I have learned a lot while studying for those certifications. The main purpose of why I created this blog is to share the resources and the topics for the knowledge that I have learned from studying those certifications and have a Tagalog explanation to help my fellow Filipinos. 

I mostly used my free time on learning Routing & Switching specially the technologies that the company I’m working on has like BGP, IS-IS, OSPF, VPLS, MPLS-TE, Multicast Routing (PIM, IGMP) , and other technologies or protocols for an ISP. When I don’t feel like studying R&S I switch on  learning Linux and Network Automation(Python, APIs, Docker and etc.) and many other things like web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, front-end frameworks like Angular or React) because in the future I want to design or perhaps just help the web developers to integrate the backend automation for the network to a beautiful Dashboard UI and also to improve this website. Currently I’m writing codes in Python but I plan to study also Golang after I’m comfortable already using Python. For now I have only small personal projects that I’m currently working on which I will share on the Programming Page of this blog.

Previously I worked as a Technical Engineer where I have different Projects that involves designing and deploying Access Points, Wireless Controllers and Wireless Management Systems to large ports and warehouses in the Philippines.

Aside from Technology, I also enjoy watching movies, documentaries videos, and going out with my family or friends to eat and have some beers.
