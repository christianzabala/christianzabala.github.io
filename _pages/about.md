[Christian Zabala]({{/assets/images/csz.png}}){: .img-small-width .float-right}

On a short period of time I have already learned and uderstands various IT technologies and have gain different Industry certifications. I have achived by keeping myself motivated and being curious on different kinds of technologies and that results on me studying and doing labs most of the time, so I can gain more IT Industry Certifications on the future and help me on my job to better serve the company I'm working for.

Currently, I work as a NOC Engineer for a Internet Service Provider account of Concentrix, where I monitor client network, support field technicians, handle various kinds of tickets , perform maintenances and troubleshoot network outages.

Previously, I was a Technical Service Engineer on a IT solutions company, my primarily role there is as a wireless engineer in-charge in wireless infrastructure design and implementation. My team also finds creative solutions for the challenges of our client network and mobility technology

In a nutshell, my passion in the IT field specially on networking is coupled with the enthusiasm to learn a lot and apply it on my job. I'm not the typical employee who just go to the office and do my job responsibilities, I'm the person who actually wants to contribute more and share to others the knowledge that I have. 

If you do something you love you never work a day in your life!
