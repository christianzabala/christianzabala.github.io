This post is all about how I started learning Network Automation. I used the [JNCIA-DevOps course](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/devops?tab=jnciadevops) as a guide on the things that I need to study in doing some network automation stuff. After I finished the course and pass the exam, I understand more the automation being done on the company I’m working for, I was able to read the Python codes they are using, and  realized the benefit or the importance of the existing automations it gives for the business.  

On this post I used the Network Automation but other words may also have connection like NetDevOps, Network Programmability, SDN(Software Defined Networking), and etc.

Others might want me to go already to the point on how did I got a free exam voucher so here it is:

1. As of now the JNCIA-DevOps is only available on [Open learning website](https://openlearning.juniper.net/jol-courses/) unlike other courses like JNCIA-Junos and JNCIA-Cloud which I think they are already available on the [Junos Genius](www.junosgenius.net).
2. Click for a live sessions course you want to take ex. [JNCIA-DevOps Preparation](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=11060)
3. Choose a date that has still available slot to register
4. Click the register > Customer & Partner Login, If you don’t have a Juniper account yet, click on the New user but if you already have go ahead and use it.
5. After you register, you will most likely have emails regarding you registration, Event reminder and how to have an access for the materials. Note: All emails are not sent for just one day 
6. Perhaps 2 days before the course start date you will get an email on how to have an access on the course material on [Junos Genius](https://cloud.contentraven.com/junosgenius/index) so make sure you already have a working account for Junos Genius 
7. Once your account has the course you have chosen on the Juniper Open Learning tab then proceed on studying the self paced video course
8. After you finish the course modules, you will need to take the Voucher Assessment Test which you must pass it within 3 attempts only but it doesn’t have any time limit.
9. After you pass the assessment test you will need to click a button then you will get an email with the voucher code for the exam that you will apply for the Pearson Vue exam.

And that’s how simple it is to get an Exam voucher worth of $200 US dollars., Those steps is also applicable for JNCIA-Junos, JNCIA-Cloud and JNCDA, which I plan to have post of the resources I used to pass those exams.

The Course might be enough already to pass the exam for individuals who already have existing knowledge already on most of the exam topics. But if you are a complete beginner like me you may want to continue studying on other resources. I have listed below the books, video courses, and other links that I used to pass the exam and help me on my daily work which I’m sure will also help others, especially for those who are just starting to learn about network automation. 

### My Recommended books to read:
You may want to check out David Bombal video [Best Python books for Network Engineers! Learn Python and Network Automation: CCNA | Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E09VFtuvrEE) since it is the one that influences me to read the following books which was really helpful for me on my first step in learning network automation. I was not able to finish yet some of the books and courses I listed here since I only study what I think would help me to pass the exam but in the future after I solidify my networking skills needed for my daily work or perhaps my work needed me to automate some stuff for the company then I will surely study all the needed things to enhance my skill on network automation. But I sometimes go back to studying Python when I got bored on the networking stuff , if there’s a company tool or script I can’t understand and if I have an Idea to automate some stuff on my daily work.

  **1. [Introducing Python - Modern Computing in Simple Packages](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028659.do)**
    - Python is the most useful tool for network automation and it is the most supported programming language on the networking community so I suggested first this book and since most of the existing open source codes are written in Python. This book explains Python concepts in a simple way like comparing the Python commands on a real life object and the book starts on the basic knowledge needed in Python programming. I was able to read only upto chapter 6 only but I think it is enough just to pass the JNCIA-Junos exam but if you want to really sharpen your skill in Python programming I suggest you read the whole book, which I also planned after I solidify my skills in networking. 

  **2. [Network Programmability and Automation](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-Automation-Next-Generation-Engineer-ebook/dp/B079K6HWQX)**
    -If you know already know or have an experience already on writing scripts using Python, you may want to start already on this book since this book already contains all the essential knowledge needed in your Network automation journey. I did not yet also finished this book and was able to read only upto Chapter 6. For me this book explains well the topic that didn’t get explain well or I was not able to understand on the JNCIA-DevOps online module, so I suggest go ahead and check the contents of this book and find the contents that will geek you out and really want to be a unicorn on the networking field. 

  **3. [Network Automation with Ansible - Jason Edelman](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/network-automation-with/9781492042389/)**
    - The JNCIA-DevOps exam has lot of Ansible concepts needed also, and this book will surely help you understand on how ansible works which is only 45 pages which I think it is all you needed for the exam except for the Juniper Junos Ansible modules.

  **4. [Mastering Python Networking](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-python-networking)**
    - This book may overlap some topics on the 3 books above but this book contains great topics also that was not included on those 3 books plus it has great real word examples that is explained in a simple way.

  **4. [Juniper Free Day One books](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/jnbooks/)**
    - This are the books that I was able to read, I did not dig deeper for all the books listed here since most of the further chapters on each book will not be included in the exam and I don’t get to interface them on my daily work. If you read these books you will get high chance to pass the exam since there are a lot of exam questions that can be found on these books.
      * Day One: Automating Junos® with Ansible, 2nd Edition - upto Chapter 12 (Scan only some chapters)
      * Day One: Automating Junos with Salt - upto Chapter 2
      * Junos PyEZ Cookbook - was able to scan the whole book(200 pages) since the 23 Recipes on this book was very interesting since it will give me an Idea on what are the probable automation stuff I can do in the future. 
      * Using JSNAP to Automate Network Verifications - only 128 page book same reason as the PyEZ Cookbook on why I finished the whole book.
      * This Week: Mastering Junos Automation Programming - Scan the book upto chapter 2, got bored on SLAX topic.





### My Recommended Video Courses to watch:

  **1. [JNCIA-Cloud](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/resources/jncia-cloud/)**
    - I recommend to enroll this free course first since this will give you an overview on how the cloud works since most of the knowledge you can acquire on this course like SDN,NFV, and some automation will surely help you understand some of the concepts for the JNCIA-DevOps exam.

  **2. [Cisco DevNet - Network Programmability Basics](https://developer.cisco.com/video/net-prog-basics/)**
    - This course might be for Cisco products but it is really helpful for me on my Network automation journey and Hank Preston explain well the topics and the role of a Network Engineer nowadays. I just watch Module 1 and 2 only on this free video course but you can learn a lot from those videos. There's a lot of other free DevNet Tracks you can choose on the [Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/) website plus there are labs you can work on. A sample explanation about Cisco Devnet and about Hank Preston can be watched on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tarqb6uRvX8&t=122s) of David Bombal.
    
  **3. [Pinoy Python - Programming Tutoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IfJ_rwj8SA&list=PL7uPIMVcTgxlqtlGvcnO_Q72P4b5Nzm_W)l**
    - I recommend this free youtube video tutorial for my fellow Filipinos since the Python Basic Concepts is explained well Tag-lish and in layman's terms.

  **4. [INE - Automation & Systems Category](https://my.ine.com/search?query=Automation%20Systems)**
- There are plenty of Automation Video courses available on INE which are all helpful but for now I only choose 4 of them since some overlaps with other videos. Luckily the company I’m working for had given us a INE account. :heart_eyes:
 
  * [Python Programming for Network Engineers](https://my.ine.com/course/ine-python-programming/7477146c-397b-4510-b910-1108608879b5) - was able to watch upto Control Structures :: Breaking Out of Loops.
  * [Python Programming for Network Engineers](https://my.ine.com/course/ine-python-101-for-network-engineers/448da730-773e-49a0-a4a2-6eb675288b7e)
  * [Practical Python Cisco Network Automation](https://my.ine.com/course/ine-practical-python-cisco-network-automation/3be5db2b-43fb-4510-9288-d9c6913a9037)
  * [GIT Fundamentals](https://my.ine.com/course/ine-git-fundamentals/1f09eded-6c92-4a68-ac7e-043c48bd35c1)

  **5. Youtube Videos** -There are a lot of free videos on youtube that is related to Network Automation, But it’s up to you to choose only what is helpful for your career. Here are the videos that I was able to watched that I’m sure that all of them are really helpful for a person who is starting his/her Network Automation journey:


  * [NetDevOps: Hank Preston and David Bombal discuss the future of Network DevOps: Cisco Python, Automation, NETCONF, SDN, Docker, Kubernetes and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tarqb6uRvX8&list=PLhfrWIlLOoKMduetaIJgOoQCyfiJNEX74) - Currently 26 great videos from David and Hank since it is more of a question and answer series for NetDevOps not just pure discussion.

  * [NetDevOps Live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6ZoQ1QRw7I&list=PL2k86RlAekM-0_lErsVdS_xqQMLYRcdhU) - Currently there are 27 videos on this playlist of Cisco Devnet, I did not watch yet all of it but I’m able to watch most of the videos during my commute and when I have vacant time on my work. :smile:



### Other resources that I used:
  **1. [coodict/python3-in-one-pic](https://github.com/coodict/python3-in-one-pic/blob/master/README.md)** - The mind map of coodict repository is great way to connect the concepts needed together with example use but the IPython Notebook is more useful for me since it serves as my reviewer and together with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), I use it to learn Python.

  **2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)** -  This application is what I have installed on my Windows 10 laptop for studying Python plus Jupyter notebook is already included on its installer.

  **3. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/?fromMenu)** - This is the Integrated Development Environment(IDE) I used for creating my Python script projects like my [CSZ tool](https://github.com/christianzabala/CSZ-Tool), but there are other great IDEs you can used, I suggest to choose what you prefer. IDE is not that necessary for the JNCIA-DevOps exam but if you want to pursue your Network Automation career, an IDE is really important tool for developing programs. You may want to check out David video about [Python IDEs for network engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdF_4YpRJg) for more info.

  **4. [GitHub](https://github.com/)** - This platform is for collaboration of code projects and a place where you can store your codes(Private or Public). This may not be necessary for the JNCIA-DevOps exam but it is also an essential tool for the Network Automation Track.  A great discussion about GitHub can be viewed on this [David & Hank Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OoGuLH9IwU&t=69s)

 **5. [Juniper TechLibrary](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/)** - If you are struggling to find information regarding topics that are for Juniper only, this is the site where you can find a lot of information.
 
  **6. [Zeroslah](https://www.zeroslash.io/)** - a blog which has majority of the posts are for Network Automation and it is owned by Jess Primero which I suggest to my fellow Filipinos to go visit his blog and his [FB page](https://web.facebook.com/pg/iamzeroslash/posts/) which contains great information and motivational posts. He has a pdf back then which is about “8 Things you need to know to get started with Network Automation” which I can’t find anymore but that pdf serves as my blueprint in studying for Network Automation when I there are no free JNCIA-DevOps exam yet. I think he has a Network Automation course perhaps just chat him on his fb page if you want to learn more about Network Automation in Tag-lish. You may want to also watch this Video of my 2 Filipino Idols: [CCNAPHILIPPINES Expert Interview with Jess Primero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJyKQ30Tm0c).

**Note:** You might think that I did not install or practice around other tools that is included in the exam like Ansible. I did not yet play around with it since the concepts is only needed for the exam and I’m not going to interface with it yet on my present job since they mostly used Python and [Go]( https://golang.org) for the automation works since there are more benefits in using them for example the multithreaded on python which is really useful when pushing new configs simultaneously to multiple network devices, but I’m not sure if Ansible doesn’t have that feature and there are more codes available on the community for Python than Ansible. Overall I just want to study more on a programming language since you can do more higher level of abstraction and better control during troubleshooting and validation.

That’s all I can think of for now but there might be other resources that I used that I already forgot since I often just google around the web so if you find something difficult just search the web. If you find some useful stuff that can help other then you may want to share it in the comments section. 

### My Advice:
  * If you feel or think that you can’t handle the topics for the exam or learning a Programming is hard, always remember that there is no person that was born that already knows how to write codes, All of us always start at the beginning and a constant practice is the key to be successful on your chosen path.

  * If you find learning Python difficult, just start on learning just the basics like how to manipulate the native data types then think of something that you want to play around or there is a manual work you always do that you think writing a script could help you. You may want to search for easy python projects that you can work on to get a grasp on writing and reading Python codes.

  * Overall the JNCIA-DevOps exam just focus only on concepts, is up to you if you want to study more in-depth for you to excel in your career and adapting to new changes in the networking field so that you will not get left behind. :sunglasses:
 
Thank you for reading this post and I hope you can get a lot of information here for your journey to Network Automation .
