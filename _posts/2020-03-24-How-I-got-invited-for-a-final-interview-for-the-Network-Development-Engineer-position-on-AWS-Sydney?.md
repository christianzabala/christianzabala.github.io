I wasn’t able to create a post on this site since last October 2019 because I was preparing for the interviews for the Network Development Engineer role for AWS. Luckily now I have extra time again to write posts that could perhaps help others in their career, So I decided why not share first my AWSome experience on my journey to pass one of my dream job which I wasn’t able to achieve yet but perhaps someday I can finally pass the final interview if I get lucky to be called again, or perhaps I can achieve a similar kind of role here in the Philippines since it is better if you can see your family for just a couple of hours of travel.

**NOTE:**  I will not be sharing the Interview questions on this post since I have signed a NDA and for sure I'm not an expert engineer yet so all of this is just my own opinion so it's also better if you have a friend that already has a lot of experienced on the networking field that you can ask for questions or advice.

For what I can remember I first saw the job posting on a facebook group around July or August of 2019 but I did not apply for it immediately since I still enjoy and still have a lot to learn my current job, and also  the job requirements is 5+ years of experience which I don’t have yet, even combining my first job which is not mainly network related role, I only have 2+ years of experience back then. But the job description got stuck on my head for days that made me look for the job posting several times until I decided to study the needed qualifications for the role. 
I often study all the time but mostly basic concepts of different technologies, until September of 2019 when I decided to start a in depth studies on OSPF, BGP, TCP, and (MPLS, IS-IS, & Multicast since I included it on my CV). 
The exact job posting title was “Network Development Engineer - Manila Hiring Event” which indicated that they will have a face to face interview in November 2019 for those who pass the phone interview, so I only applied on October 8, 2019 and not applied early in August since I was not prepared for a phone interview yet. Just a couple hours of my application I received an email that they invited me for a Digital interview but it is not required to attend it right away, so I continue to review the different routing protocols till October 15, 2019 when I proceeded on the digital interview, which there was questions displayed and will just give you few seconds to read it then the app will record your video for the answer on a limited time depending on how complex the question is. The question and answer lasted around 30 minutes. After I submitted my interview video, I thought I won’t be able to pass that since I have answers that I’m not sure if it was correct and some were incomplete due to the time restrictions. Luckily the next day I received an email that they want me to fill up a form  to schedule a phone interview. They were able to schedule me last Oct 28, 2019 and also gave the name the person who will interview me, so I checked his LinkedIn and it got me pressured since he was a CCIE with lots of great experience already. The email contains already what to expect on the interview and tips to do well on the interview. It also has a Network Development Engineer - Interview preparation document that contains background about the role, Topics to review: (BGP, OSPF, TCP, MPLS, Ethernet/IP, Hardware, Past Environments, Troubleshooting, and Project Ownerships),   Interview  Tips,  Amazon Leadership Principles and other useful links. Those documents really help me prepare for the overall interview.  One of the Amazon Talent acquisition team tried to contact me but I wasn’t able to answer the call but he emailed to give some tips and how to prepare on the day of my phone interview which should have been very helpful for me since he included that I will be asked to talk about a Major routing protocol at least one in length, Which I wasn’t able to give importance since I still studied BGP, OSPF, and IS-IS during my preparation  for which I  should have gave me more time to construct a STAR (Situation/Task/Action/Result) for answering the questions related to Amazon’s Leadership Principles. 
The phone interview started with scenario based questions that will related to the leadership principles, for what I can remember there 2 or 3 questions was asked and one of it did not went well since I lack of details for my answer, second part was technical questions and on that part I was slightly satisfied on my answers since I choose to discuss OSPF. The last part was some fundamentals and automation(I chose Python) questions, after that I was able to ask some questions and one of them was “ What are the possible things that I can improve?” which he said to me that my answers must be detailed since Amazon is data driven and I must have a really in depth knowledge of the protocols being used.  So after that I started to doubt the outcome of my interview and started to relax with my studies. But on November 1, I received an email with great news that said that I passed the phone interview and not only that, they said that the face to face interview will be in Sydney which is supposed to be in Manila.  I was very happy that day since I didn’t experience riding a plane yet even domestic flights and all of it was shouldered by AWS. For me it’s already a win-win scenario since I would be able to experience going to Sydney and be interviewed by the engineers of AWS. 
My interview was supposed to be last December 3 but it got moved to January 21 because I wasn’t able to get my VISA right away which is great for me since it gave me more time to study.
 I arrived in Sydney the day before the interview and I just refreshed the documents that I made for my interview preparation like Technical and Scenario based questions. I wasn’t able to sleep well during the flight so I was able to get an almost 8 hours sleep before my interview.
The first person who interviewed me was the hiring manager and it was all about the Leadership principles which for me it went well since we are just like talking casually  and I was able to answer his questions. My second, third, and fourth interview was  technical and scenario based questions. Which are all on the interview preparation document that was given to me. But there are questions that I wasn’t able to answer or gaved a clear explanation.  After the interview I still try to be Optimistic about the outcome of my interview so that I could still enjoy my stay in Sydney since I was able to have 3 days of stay in Sydney before my flight back to Manila.
 I was able to hear the result of my interview last February 7, which was fine for me since they informed me already that the 4 persons that have interviewed me will not be able to discuss immediately with each other. The talent acquisition personnel was nice to still call me to talk about the result even if I failed since other companies will just say they will just inform you about the result which they never did. She also talks about the details of my result like they know I have the potential for the role but unfortunately they were able to get the number of engineers already for their team.  I was sad that day but I still think of the result as a positive way like there are a lot of things that I still need to study, because of that interview it gave me the perseverance to really dive deep to the technologies being used in the Industry nowadays, and I said to myself that  is was not just the right time for me yet and I can still try next time with a more technical and a experienced person. During my flight to Sydney I was able to meet 2 Filipinos also that will also go for that interview and I was able to ask their experience and they were already have a great foundation and for me I was still just starting on my networking career as a NOC engineer, so I’m  already thankful that I was able to achieve to be on the final interview on AWS.

**Resources that I have studied:** 
  * I have many resources that I have studied on my almost 5 months of preparation so I will not list it all here, but most of them are on this post “[My personal goal for 2019-2020](https://divide-and-conquer.network/pesonal%20development/My-Personal-Goal-for-2019-2020/)” especially those that I crossed out on video training for INE ex. BGP, OSPF, MPLS, TCP, and Python.
  * The others ones are the videos of cisco live website: 
      * [Troubleshooting OSPF - BRKRST-3310: Nicholas Russo](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=ospf#/session/1542224324396001rr0i) 
      *  [Troubleshooting BGP - BRKRST-3320](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=bgp#/session/14479207948420017zOu)
      *  [Troubleshooting End-to-End MPLS - BRKMPL-3124](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=mpls#/session/14545296394170016WcY)
      *  [Multicast Troubleshooting - BRKIPM-2264](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=#/session/1542224318892001rjEi) - Not so important

      *  I have watch videos about OSPF, BGP, MPLS, and Automation on [TeamNANOG](https://www.youtube.com/user/TeamNANOG) and [CHI-NOG](https://www.youtube.com/user/chicagonog) youtube channels which are really great videos that will surely help anyone on their career.
      
      * [Dan Croitor'Youtube'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0uQHve23oMWgQcTTpgQsQ) - I have watched his videos for preparing for the Amazon's Leadership Principles and other behavioral questions.
      
      * Cisco and Juniper Documentation - If you are done watching training videos, read the topic you have learned so your mind will really understand or build the concept you have studied and not just put it on your short-term memory.

      *  [The Broadcast Storm](https://open.spotify.com/show/17USQEYa2UL1OoQ9qIeHAf) on spotify which is the podcasts of  Kevin Wallace is also very helpful for me since I was able to hear the different educational podcast during my commute and while I’m walking going to the office or home. I can’t remember how many times I have played his podcast about OSPF and BGP.


      *  AWS re:Invent  - I have watched AWS re:Invent Youtube videos especially those related to their network infrastructure, I was never asked about their network, but who knows what questions would they might ask perhaps someone might ask related to their Network design since you can get a lot of information on how they address different networking design issues. Plus you might get ideas on those videos on what you would like to ask the interviewers. 



**Resources that I should have studied:**

  * [Day One: Data Center Fundamental](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/DC_Fundamentals.pdf) -  I have read the chapter 1 to 5 of this book but I wasn’t able to apply it on my interview and I forgot what I read about it, it's because I prioritize learning what a service provider has which the field I currently working at. 
      
  * [THIS WEEK: DATA CENTER DEPLOYMENT WITH EVPN/VXLAN](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/TW_DCDeployment.v2.pdf) - For me if I could have just read this, it may gave me some advantage from other applicants even though I don't know what AWS used on its underlay and overlay

  * [Building DataCenter networks with VXLAN BGP-EVPN - BRKDCT-3378](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=vxlan#/session/14479207932160017kz7) or this new one [Building DataCenter Networks with VXLAN BGP EVPN - BRKDCN-3378](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=vxlan#/session/1564527371183001cumc) - This will compensate for the Juniper ebook I listed above.
      
  * [Juniper QFX5100 Series](https://www.amazon.com/Juniper-QFX5100-Comprehensive-Building-Next-Generation-ebook/dp/B00PWJU6IA) or [NX-OS and Cisco Nexus Switching](https://www.amazon.com/NX-OS-Cisco-Nexus-Switching-Next-Generation-ebook/dp/B00BY87XIO) - I think mastering a hardware from those 2 vendors or other vendors even just one that is mostly used in a datacenter environment would be really helpful. 
      
  * [Linux Fundamentals for Network Engineers](https://my.ine.com/course/linux-fundamentals/6057e3f0-5b40-476e-85d1-350b74a16836) - Having a knowledge in linux is already essential for a Network engineer role especially if you are also working on a network that has an automation on it since most of the open source tools available are on linux, so it’s very important the a network engineer know how to work around on linux. Luckily for me our workstation is a linux distro but I realize that working on it day to day did not give me enough knowledge on what are the commands or tricks on using linux.

  * There are great videos on [TeamNANOG](https://www.youtube.com/user/TeamNANOG) and [CHI-NOG](https://www.youtube.com/user/chicagonog) that I wasn’t able to watch back then, especially those related to Datacenter

For sure every candidate for the Network Development Engineer role or any person that is going to a Job hunt  would not have the same time that I was able to allocate, and every person has different experience and skill set, so just choose  the resources that you want to study especially those that you are not comfortable yet.

**TIPS:**
  *  Master first the basic fundamental concepts because that will serve as your foundation on how can you be able to quickly learn or retain the knowledge that you have studied on the advance technologies 
  *  Don’t hesitate to answer their questions even If you are not confident in the knowledge you currently have because you don't know if the question that you decided to skip might be a big factor in their selection process. 
  *  Don’t be afraid to fail or try something new, so you don’t get left behind.
  *  Create your own document for the Interview question. For me I used Google Docs since I can access it anywhere and since my handwriting is not that good :smile: , Example docs that I made:
      * Technical Q&A
      * Troubleshooting Q&A
      * Interview Q&A (contains common interview questions for different company and the questions that I want to ask to the interviewer)
      * AWS Interview Q&A (research it on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Amazon-Interview-Questions-E6036.htm))
      * Protocols Docs (For example BGP doc, I always document what I have learned during watching BGP training videos, reading books, and on vendor documentation so that I can easily find something when I forgot something. This also help me retain what I have learned.)
      
  *   The role requires deep knowledge of different protocols used in networking which may vary depending on the role of the team you will apply for, so it’s important you really know the major protocols in networking. For example TCP, you must not settle on knowing that it uses three-way handshake. You must know how it achieves reliability and flow control, what are the fields on the TCP header including the flag bits and their purposes, and how it tears down the session. But you don’t have to master it or be like a human wireshark, for me I think you just need to understand how it really works but for sure it’s a plus if you can answer an Expert type of question.
 
  *  Create your own automation tool or script that could help you or your current team remove some manual works on your day to day job. Nowadays, having programming language knowledge will surely help you get the job you wanted. But make sure that you can clearly explain what you have created and what is the result of the script that you made since most probably you will get asked about it.
  
  * Practice, Practice, Practice! Try doing a mock interview with someone you know or simulate it on your own, ask interview questions to yourself or think of the technical questions in your head then write your answer on a paper.
  
  * Be Curious! If you are not curious about how things work, then you should start learning to be curious because curiosity leads you to really understand the things that you are studying since you will really deep dive into it. If you are not curious enough on how protocols work then perhaps you don't have passion on what you are doing.
  
  *  Lastly just relax during every interview that you would take because if you get nervous you can't think clearly. Just  be yourself and trust yourself that you could answer their questions or will pass the interview.
