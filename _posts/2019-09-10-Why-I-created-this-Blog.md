title: "Why I created this Blog?"
---

I started this blog not just to share the knowledge to others but also for myself because I want to start early on documenting 
on the things that I have learned so I can have an online reference that I can read and recall the information or resources that
I gather from basic technology concepts upto complex technology Which I recommend to others to do also since if you are not using 
a particular technology often you will not fully retain the information you have studied. By also sharing the others what you have
learned especially if you explain it in your own words expect from it that you can retain more information rather than just reading 
the concept.

As I said on my [About](https://christianzabala.github.io/about/) page that I’m a curios person, so by having this blog also helps me organize my thoughts and express my interest. 

I use the divide and conquer the network as a domain name not just because its my most used way of troubleshooting but it also
because I want to divide the explanation for the technical topics that I wrote to English and Tagalog so my fellow Filipinos can
easily understand the concepts that I have shared so that they can conquer their networking career.

On this blog, I will also share some tips in life not only just technology stuff because I want others to also learn from my mistakes or 
apply the things that I do that may also benefit them. 

Making this blog is also a way to improve my communication and writing skills, even though I'm not physically talking to someone I just 
trick myself as I'm speaking on a crowd.

That's it, Thanks for viewing my blog and I hope that the topics that I have shared will not just contribute to my learning but also to your learning as well.
