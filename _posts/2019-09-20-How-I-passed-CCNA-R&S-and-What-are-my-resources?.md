In this post I will share my  journey on conquering the CCNA Routing & Switching certification exam. I have first List the 
resources that I studied on this post because not might all people are interested on my short story, but  if you have time 
to read then go ahead and perhaps you get motivated to return on what you are studying. The resources listed here is only books,
videos, and websites since I only self studied for the exam. For my practice lab I only used 
[GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/software/download) and [Cisco Packet tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
to get a hands on experience on a virtualized Cisco device.

###  My Recommended books to read:

  **1. CCNA Basic and Fundamentals, Billy Ramirez(CCNAPH)**
    -I suggested this first book for my fellow Filipinos since it is written in Tag-lish so a Filipino can understand clearly the concepts needed to pass the CCNA R&S. It has only 390 pages so you will not get discouraged by the amount of pages that you need to read, I got this ebook by enrolling to his course but if you want only his ebook it will only cost you 499 pesos which in return will give you more than the price of it when you find a networking job. This is the [link](https://www.ccnaphilippines.com/the-ebook/)  and I will let Billy do the explanation.

  **2. Cisco CCNA Study Guide v2.71, Aaron Balchunas (Routeralley)**
    - This might be an old study guide but who cares its free! Plus the content of it is short(321 pages) but it is concise. You can skip the technologies that are already been removed on the CCNA v3 exam like IGRP so you can lessen your reading time. He has other guides also on his [website](https://www.routeralley.com/guides.html)  like CCNP Routing and Switching.
   
  **3. (EXAM CRAM) CCNA Routing and Switching 200-125, Anthony Sequira**
    - I read this book after I have watched most of the video guides that I have and the first 2 books I listed above, to refresh what I have learned during the last 3 months before I took the exam. This book has a CramSaver questions which you can base your understanding if you can skim the pages and just read the ExamAlert which are the important concepts, after topics there are also CramQuiz for every major section of a chapter and at the end of each chapter there is a Review Questions. The last part of this book also has two final exams. So overall you will get practices by these questions that will surely help you on the actual exam.

  **4. CCNA Routing and Switching (Portable Command Guide) 4th Edition, Scott Empson**
    - As you can see from its name this book are for the brief explanation for every Cisco IOS commands needed during the exam, not all but most of it.  I read this book before I do the lab so that I can understand what are the purposes of the commands that I input on a virtual router or a switch rather than experimenting or doing ? most of the time. This book has a topology for most of each topic that will be used for the configuration part, and that helps me visualize the overall configuration of a topic. There are also Tips and hints on this book that helped me on the exam and also in my day to day job. [Link for the book](https://www.amazon.com/Routing-Switching-Portable-Command-100-105/dp/1587205882)

  **5. CCNA Routing and Switching Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odomn**
    - This book is very essential when taking the CCNA R&S exam because it covers a lot of in depth the topics needed to pass the CCNA R&S exam, you can already base it on the number of pages it has. But I wasn't able to read the whole book, I just read the topics that did not understand well or the topics that didn’t get explained more in depth on 4 books that I listed above because everytime I want to read this book I always get destructed immediately by the number of pages it has :joy: . But that’s the time when I did not enjoy much on reading books but perhaps today when I decided to take the new CCNP exam I think I will read all the pages of the official cert guide for CCNP Enterprise since I am now used to reading books since I understand more clearly the information on a technology on reading books rather than just watching videos courses.  [Link for the book](https://www.amazon.com/Routing-Switching-200-125-Official-Library-ebook/dp/B01M26PU48/ref=sr_1_3?crid=267C6K07VNFCB&keywords=ccna+200-125&qid=1568747518&s=digital-text&sprefix=ccna+200%2Cdigital-text%2C358&sr=1-3)


### My Recommended Video Courses to watch:

  **1. CCNA v3.0 Masterclass, CCNAPH**
    -I First Video Course recommended for my fellow Filipinos since this one supplements the ebook of Billy Ramirez. I enrolled on this course when it is not yet finished so I think it is still around 5k PHP back then, but today I don’t know what is the price and if it is still open but Billy is very approachable just email or chat with him on his [FB page](https://web.facebook.com/ccnaph?_rdc=1&_rdr). I can’t count the number of videos anymore on this course from my last check since it has a detailed explanation of each topic included on the exam and he continuously adding new videos that can help his students, but the videos are not that long I think 30 minutes is the longest one so for me it helps me understand better the concepts needed for the exam and there are other videos like career tips, goal setting, Coaching Sessions, Expert Interview Series and etc. Overall the price is worth it plus you will not get bored while watching this course aside on how he teaches but also because it is taglish so as a Filipino I was able to easily understand the things that he explained. 

  **2. Cisco CCENT/CCNA 100-105 ICND1 & Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching 200-105 ICND2, CBTnuggets (Jeremy Cioara)**
    -If you watch this video and completely understand all or most of the topics that Jeremy explained and combine the books that I suggested for sure you will already get a high probability of passing the exam. Jeremy teaches with a lot of energy for this course but also on to his other video courses that I watched, so l think you will not get bored every time you watch his videos IF you are really interested in learning the technology. Aside from the way he explains, the other factors that makes this course great is because of the presentation especially the lab parts which it is not much scripted so he encounters to some issues along the way that he needs to troubleshoot which can also helps his viewers, there are also some jokes along the explanations :smile:. [ICND1 Link](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco-ccna-icnd1-100-105) & [ICND2 Link](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/icnd2-200-105)
    
  **3. CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep 1-9, Lynda(Mike Meyers)**
    -During the time I started studying the CCNA R&S my only background in networking was mostly wireless technology which is because of my first job, so I lack of solid basic background of the networking technologies which I think it’s the most important thing to study because if you did not master the basics you can’t truly understand the more complex technologies that is above those basic concepts. So this course really helped me understand and visualize what is happening on the network since I think most of the time he is using an object to explain the concepts. Here's the [Link](https://www.lynda.com/Mike-Meyers/4782109-1.html) of Mike courses which includes CompTIA A+ which I think will be really helpful for those people that don’t yet have a technical background.

  **4. Youtube**
    -There’s a lot of CCNA R&S resources here on youtube in fact I started on youtube for learning the topics on the CCNA R&S but when I already have the video courses I listed above I only search here the topics that did not much get dig into on those Video courses. Then after watching topics here I go to the books to understand more. Like the [QoS topics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ccna+qos+kevin+wallace) which is explained well by [Kevin Wallace](https://www.kwtrain.com/).
    
    
### Other Video Courses that I think might be helpful on the exam and also to your job:

  **1. [CBT Nuggets - IT Expert: Installing Network Cabling and Devices](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/it-expertise-routing-switching)**  
  
  **2. [CBT Nuggets -Cisco R&S Troubleshooting Mastery](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco-routing-switching-troubleshooting)**
  
  **3. [CBT Nuggets - Professional Course: Building a Network Design that Works](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/building-a-network-design-that-works)**
  
  
### Other resources that I used:

  **1. Google** 
    -If you did not understand a certain topic or technology, GOOGLE it! Lots of resources you can find on the internet and most of them are already free, you are the only problem if you can’t find the things that you want to learn.
  
  **2. Cisco website** 
    -Well most of the time if you google a certain topic or questions, you will most likely to land on a Cisco website like the Cisco Community website. You can find a lot of information on the cisco websites alone you might even don’t need a book :astonished:, there are smart engineers on the cisco community helping on questions already posted there that can help you on the things you are studying.

  **3. Packetlife.net Cheat Sheets** 
    -This was my main source of most of my personal cheat sheet, Almost all the things you need for a particular technology that is summarized is already included on his cheat sheet. Of course there are maybe some information not included on his cheat sheets but that's why I have my own personal cheat sheet that I can edit. [Link for the Cheatsheets](https://packetlife.net/library/cheat-sheets/)

If you want to know how to pass the CCNA exam, then go ahead and read this [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-pass-the-CCNA-exam) which already has the answer and tips to pass the CCNA exam, sadly I did not found this while I’m still studying and I learned the techniques the hard way :joy:

<summary><h3>How did I passed the CCNA Routing & Switching Exam on my First take?</h3></summary>
<details>
<br>
The answer is simple, **I enjoyed the process**  of learning the topics involved in the exam and also other technologies in the networking field. 

>If you have an internet connection and the **Desire** to do anything, you can figure out how to do it!

Ok so how did I enjoy learning networking stuff even though I’m not the type of person who always study during my college days? It started on my first job, the primary technology that I handled there was all about wireless like access points, wireless controllers, and wireless management system. During my first job we interface with IT personnels of our clients so I need to study some basic networking stuff to be able to explain more about the capabilities of our products but the basics did not work well for me because other IT folks are smart enough to get me caught off guard by their questions that are related to networking which is are reasonable questions since those APs will be attached to their network. So I look at it as a challenge for me to study more about networking. Another reason why started learning network stuff is because I got amazed while watching one of our client network engineer that is doing magical stuff on the CLI when he was configuring or troubleshooting on a router and a switch and that was the time I got more curious and motivated to study about networking since that was the kind of job I want to achieve so I started searching on google on how to be a network engineer and what are the requirements on the job posting websites and almost all of it points to taking the CCNA R&S certification and after that I start to research the materials that I need.

Back then I don’t have a decent personal laptop but luckily for me my company that time provided me a decent laptop for my daily work and  that  laptop was able to handle most of my lab work needed for the exam. The apartment that I stayed don’t have wifi connection so everytime I’m on the office I download all the things I needed  since there's a lot of free resources on the internet. I remember that the first ccna related videos that I watch is the videos of [NetworKing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2D1o-aM-2s&list=PLh94XVT4dq02frQRRZBHzvj2hwuhzSByN) on youtube which was also help me to get started on studying network stuff but it was not yet completed back then so I landed on watching Jeremy Cioara video nuggets, I watch it when I arrived on our apartment and watch in on my phone when I'm not doing something in a client site and during a bus or jeepney trips. After watching most of the ICND1 videos there are concepts that I did not understand well so I search for Network+ video courses which I found Mike Meyers course and I was able to search a tagalog video course which is the course of Billy Ramirez. I watch both of them first before I continue the CBT nuggets ccna videos. When I got the concepts needed for the technology that I’m studying for the week I start labbing(configuration, verification and troubleshooting) along with the lab part of CCNAPH and CBT Nuggets course.

>Success doesn’t happen overnight. Keep your eye on the prize and don’t look back - Erwin Andrews

I think I started studying the CCNA R&S topics on April of 2017 and was able to pass the exam on January of 2019 (1yr and 10 months) since my first job was a 6 days  a week and my rest day was usually spend in doing my laundry, visit on a church, and speed time with family and friends. I also didn’t have a budget that can be allocated for the exam back then since my monthly salary was only around 17 thousand pesos which is almost the equivalent cost of the CCNA 200-125 exam. So I decided to look for a better paying job first and a role that will give me hands on experience on real network devices and a knowledge on various protocols based on experience before taking the exam but during my job hunting I can’t focus on studying for the interview and to look for a decent job when I’m still employed so as an optimistic warrior :smirk: , I resigned on April 2018 and luckily in just 1 month I got hired as a NOC engineer for an ISP in USA well huge thanks to resources I shared earlier specially to Billy(CCNAPH) that provided a great course plus the mentorship.

Then after I got hired I slightly paused on studying Cisco stuff since the network device’s the company I’m working are mostly Juniper, Nokia Alcatel-Lucent, Adtran, and only few Cisco routers. My focus got shifted to studying Juniper stuff since it will be more beneficial for me and the company I’m working for but the concepts I have learned are still applicable.  I used the JNCIA-Junos as a guide for me on what are the things I should study but I first got a free voucher for JNCDA and JNCIA-Cloud before the JNCIA-Junos exam so I study and took that exams first. I will create a separate post for the Juniper certification that I took. After I finnish the juniper certification exams and getting to feel of taking an online industry certification exam which is I think really helpful on removing the anxiety during the day of my CCNA R&S exam, I then shifted back to studying CCNA R&S. I started reading ebooks almost 5 months before my exam day since mostly I finished up already the video courses that I have. I also started combining and summarizing all the important information needed on each protocol included in the exam on my google sheet & docs.

 On December 2018 I decided finally set a schedule for my exam on January 2019 well thanks to the 13 Month pay :laughing: , Back then I didn’t feel that I’m already ready to take the exam but I feel that I’m stuck on studying the same technology over and over again. So I decided to schedule the exam so that I can move on to much more complicated networking topics. I started wrapping up the [Exam Topics](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna/ccna-exam/exam-topics)  that I can’t quite explain to myself, I read those topics when I wake up and on my commute to work and back to my apartment then do the lab when I arrived back to my apartment. For the month of December and January, I sleep mostly just 6 hours a day just to get all the topics that I need to study be completed. Then the day before my exam I just scan my Network Cheat sheet which is on my Google Sheets, which I plan to share as soon I cleaned it up. 
On the day of the exam, I tried to relax but the IPv6 topics like the addressing and OSPFv3 was not clear on my mind so I scan that topic on my way to the Pearson testing center.

> Don’t let others put thoughts into your mind that takes away your self-confidence - Katori Hall

During the exam, the technique I used was to get rid of first the obvious incorrect answers but it is not applicable on some tricky questions and related answers. :weary: . For the lab part I think I got 4 types of lab question and scenario luckily the ? is working. :grin: 
There are 2 persons also on the room was also taking the CCNA exam which I saw on the login form, and the 3 of us almost take the exam at the same time. The other person finished it quickly I think I’m still on the middle part of the exam but I ignore him and stick to my plan which is to double check all my answer before going to the next questions since I still have time. The 2nd person on the room also finished before me but I think he is disappointed in his score since he slightly smashed the table. :worried:  Once again I didn’t get on my mind that I will fail also because if that gets on to my mid perhaps it will affect how I will answer the questions. After the last question, I reviewed all the questions since I still have around 20 minutes left. Then I cross my finger when I click the submit button.
:tada: :boom: The result appears and I Passed the exam! :relaxed:
 

My Advice:
- You don’t understand something google around, LAB it down, and ask someone who really knows networking stuff. 
- Try to remove the distractions just for the sake of the exam, think of the money you have or will be spending on the exam.
- Find a person who can mentor you.
- You only limit is YOU! *Sarili mo lng kalaban mo para ikaw ay maging successful*
- When you don’t feel like studying, go watch some motivation videos on youtube, there a lot there that can motivate you. [NetworkChcuk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9x0AN7BWHpCDHSm9NiJFJQ), [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/user/ConfigTerm), and [Kevin Wallace](https://www.youtube.com/user/kwallaceccie) has motivational videos also and I watch their videos most of the time.

And that’s how I studied and passed the exam. If you want to share some experiences and resources that can help others, go ahead and comment it down below.
