## How I passed CCNA R&S and what are my resources?

In this post I will share my  journey on conquering the CCNA Routing & Switching certification exam. I have first List the 
resources that I studied on this post because not might all people are interested on my short story, but  if you have time 
to read then go ahead and perhaps you get motivated to return on what you are studying. The resources listed here is only books,
videos, and websites since I only self studied for the exam. For my practice lab I only used 
[GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/software/download) and [Cisco Packet tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
to get a hands on experience on a virtualized Cisco device.

###  My Recommended book to read:

  **1. CCNA Basic and Fundamentals, Billy Ramirez(CCNAPH)**
    -I suggested this first book for my fellow Filipinos since it is written in Tag-lish so a Filipino can understand clearly the concepts needed to pass the CCNA R&S. It has only 390 pages so you will not get discouraged by the amount of pages that you need to read, I got this ebook by enrolling to his course but if you want only his ebook it will only cost you 499 pesos which in return will give you more than the price of it when you find a networking job. This is the [link](https://www.ccnaphilippines.com/the-ebook/)  and I will let Billy do the explanation.

  **2. Cisco CCNA Study Guide v2.71, Aaron Balchunas (Routeralley)**
    - This might be an old study guide but who cares its free! Plus the content of it is short(321 pages) but it is concise. You can skip the technologies that are already been removed on the CCNA v3 exam like IGRP so you can lessen your reading time. He has other guides also on his [website](https://www.routeralley.com/guides.html)  like CCNP Routing and Switching.
   
  **3. (EXAM CRAM) CCNA Routing and Switching 200-125, Anthony Sequira**
    - I read this book after I have watched most of the video guides that I have and the first 2 books I listed above, to refresh what I have learned during the last 3 months before I took the exam. This book has a CramSaver questions which you can base your understanding if you can skim the pages and just read the ExamAlert which are the important concepts, after topics there are also CramQuiz for every major section of a chapter and at the end of each chapter there is a Review Questions. The last part of this book also has two final exams. So overall you will get practices by these questions that will surely help you on the actual exam.

  **4. CCNA Routing and Switching (Portable Command Guide) 4th Edition, Scott Empson**
    - As you can see from its name this book are for the brief explanation for every Cisco IOS commands needed during the exam, not all but most of it.  I read this book before I do the lab so that I can understand what are the purposes of the commands that I input on a virtual router or a switch rather than experimenting or doing ? most of the time. This book has a topology for most of each topic that will be used for the configuration part, and that helps me visualize the overall configuration of a topic. There are also Tips and hints on this book that helped me on the exam and also in my day to day job.

  **5. CCNA Routing and Switching Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odomn**
    - This book is very essential when taking the CCNA R&S exam because it covers a lot of in depth the topics needed to pass the CCNA R&S exam, you can already base it on the number of pages it has. But I wasn't able to read the whole book, I just read the topics that did not understand well or the topics that didn’t get explained more in depth on 4 books that I listed above because everytime I want to read this book I always get destructed immediately by the number of pages it has :joy: . But that’s the time when I did not enjoy much on reading books but perhaps today when I decided to take the new CCNP exam I think I will read all the pages of the official cert guide for CCNP Enterprise since I am now used to reading books since I understand more clearly the information on a technology on reading books rather than just watching videos courses.  [Link for the book](https://www.amazon.com/Routing-Switching-200-125-Official-Library-ebook/dp/B01M26PU48/ref=sr_1_3?crid=267C6K07VNFCB&keywords=ccna+200-125&qid=1568747518&s=digital-text&sprefix=ccna+200%2Cdigital-text%2C358&sr=1-3)


### My Recommended Video Courses to watch:

  **1. CCNA v3.0 Masterclass, CCNAPH**
    -I First Video Course recommended for my fellow Filipinos since this one supplements the ebook of Billy Ramirez. I enrolled on this course when it is not yet finished so I think it is still around 5k PHP back then, but today I don’t know what is the price and if it is still open but Billy is very approachable just email or chat with him on his [FB page](https://web.facebook.com/ccnaph?_rdc=1&_rdr). I can’t count the number of videos anymore on this course from my last check since it has a detailed explanation of each topic included on the exam and he continuously adding new videos that can help his students, but the videos are not that long I think 30 minutes is the longest one so for me it helps me understand better the concepts needed for the exam and there are other videos like career tips, goal setting, Coaching Sessions, Expert Interview Series and etc. Overall the price is worth it plus you will not get bored while watching this course aside on how he teaches but also because it is taglish so as a Filipino I was able to easily understand the things that he explained. 

  **2. Cisco CCENT/CCNA 100-105 ICND1 & Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching 200-105 ICND2, CBTnuggets (Jeremy Cioara)**
    -If you watch this video and completely understand all or most of the topics that Jeremy explained and combine the books that I suggested for sure you will already get a high probability of passing the exam. Jeremy teaches with a lot of energy for this course but also on to his other video courses that I watched, so l think you will not get bored every time you watch his videos IF you are really interested in learning the technology. Aside from the way he explains, the other factors that makes this course great is because of the presentation especially the lab parts which it is not much scripted so he encounters to some issues along the way that he needs to troubleshoot which can also helps his viewers, there are also some jokes along the explanations :smile:. [ICND1 Link](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco-ccna-icnd1-100-105) & [ICND2 Link](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/icnd2-200-105)
    
  **3. CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep 1-9, Lynda(Mike Meyers)**
    -During the time I started studying the CCNA R&S my only background in networking was mostly wireless technology which is because of my first job, so I lack of solid basic background of the networking technologies which I think it’s the most important thing to study because if you did not master the basics you can’t truly understand the more complex technologies that is above those basic concepts. So this course really helped me understand and visualize what is happening on the network since I think most of the time he is using an object to explain the concepts. Here's the [Link](https://www.lynda.com/Mike-Meyers/4782109-1.html) of Mike courses which includes CompTIA A+ which I think will be really helpful for those people that don’t yet have a technical background.

  **4. Youtube**
    -There’s a lot of CCNA R&S resources here on youtube in fact I started on youtube for learning the topics on the CCNA R&S but when I already have the video courses I listed above I only search here the topics that did not much get dig into on those Video courses. Then after watching topics here I go to the books to understand more. Like the [QoS topics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ccna+qos+kevin+wallace) which is explained well by [Kevin Wallace](https://www.kwtrain.com/).
    
    
### Other Video Courses that I think might be helpful on the exam and also to your job:

### Other resources that I used:

  **1. Google** 
    -If you did not understand a certain topic or technology, GOOGLE it! Lots of resources you can find on the internet and most of them are already free, you are the only problem if you can’t find the things that you want to learn.
  
  **2. Cisco website** 
    -Well most of the time if you google a certain topic or questions, you will most likely to land on a Cisco website like the Cisco Community website. You can find a lot of information on the cisco websites alone you might even don’t need a book :astonished:, there are smart engineers on the cisco community helping on questions already posted there that can help you on the things you are studying.

  **3. Packetlife.net Cheat Sheets** 
    -This was my main source of most of my personal cheat sheet, Almost all the things you need for a particular technology that is summarized is already included on his cheat sheet. Of course there are maybe some information not included on his cheat sheets but that's why I have my own personal cheat sheet that I can edit.
