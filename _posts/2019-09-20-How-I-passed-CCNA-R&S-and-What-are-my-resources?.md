## How I passed CCNA R&S and what are my resources?

In this post I will share my  journey on conquering the CCNA Routing & Switching certification exam. I have first List the 
resources that I studied on this post because not might all people are interested on my short story, but  if you have time 
to read then go ahead and perhaps you get motivated to return on what you are studying. The resources listed here is only books,
videos, and websites since I only self studied for the exam. For my practice lab I only used 
[GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/software/download) and [Cisco Packet tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
to get a hands on experience on a virtualized Cisco device.

### The books that I read:

  1. CCNA Basic and Fundamentals -  Billy Ramirez(CCNAPH):
    - I suggested this first book for my fellow Filipinos since it is Tag-lish so a Filipino will understand clearly the
    concepts needed for taking the CCNA R&S. It has only 390 pages so you will not get discouraged by the amount of pages
    that you will learn, I got this ebook by enrolling to his course but if you want only his ebook it will only cost you 499 pesos
    which in return will give you more than the price of it when you find a networking job. 
    This is the [link](https://www.ccnaphilippines.com/the-ebook/)  and I will let Billy do the explanation.

  2. Cisco CCNA Study Guide v2.71 - Aaron Balchunas (Routeralley):
    - This might be an old study guide but who cares its free! Plus the content of it is short(321 pages) but it is concise.
    You can skip the technologies that are already been removed on the CCNA v3 exam line IGRP so you can lessen your reading time.
    He has other guides also on his [website](https://www.routeralley.com/guides.html)  like CCNP Routing and Switching.
